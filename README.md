There are two commits composed of two iterative versions:</br>
  The first version is to write a function, take a positive as parameter, and verify if this number is perfect number. </br>
  The second version is to write a function, take lower and uppwer bound numbers as two parameters, and find out a list of perfect numbers in the range (includes boundaries).
