# perfectnumber
callsign task
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself.
There are two commits composed of two iterative versions.
The first version is to write a function, take a positive as parameter, and verify if this number is perfect number.
The second version is to write a function, take lower and uppwer bound numbers as two parameters, and find out a list of perfect numbers in the range (includes boundaries).
